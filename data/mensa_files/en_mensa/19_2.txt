Would you recommend the Golm canteen to your fellow students?
There are reasons for and against the Golm canteen. On the one hand, there are only four options for warm meals. That can be more or less, depending on to which alternative canteen you compare it. Those meals are portioned by mostly friendly canteen staffs, but unfortunately not enough to satisfy my hunger.
On the other hand, there are no other alternative locations where you can get a warm meal of that price category. You can pay easily with your student’s card or in cash if there is not enough money on that card. The meals are usually rather good and a main meal includes a free dessert or a piece of fruit.
In summary, I can recommend the Golm canteen to any person who stays in Golm anyway and needs energy to get through the day. I recommend the Nord canteen of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin to all other people.
