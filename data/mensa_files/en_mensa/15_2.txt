What makes good campus food? As far as i concerned, the key-words here are “fast”, “cheap” and “convenient”. It’s something that students can eat regularly without risking being late for a next lecture or burning a hole in their budget.

And that's exactly what Mensa is all about. It is located right in the middle of the Campus area and features a self-service buffet where one can help themselves without wasting much time waiting in line.

The prices are probably one of the biggest perks that Mensa has to offer. For students, they usually vary from 1,5 to 2,5 euro per meal, each meal including a main dish, a drink, and a dessert. There are several meal options available, including one vegetarian and one vegan.
The list of ingredients for each meal is posted online, so it is easy to find something suitable for your tastes and dietary restrictions.

As good as Mensa can be, there are also some drawbacks worth mentioning. First of all,
during the lunchtime, the Mensa is always overcrowded, to the point where it is impossible to find a place to sit. And, while the overall quality of food is pretty decent, slip-ups happen every so often. For example, i personally have once been served seriously undercooked meat.

So, what’s the conclusion? I'd say, i can recommend the Golmer Mensa to other students. In my opinion, advantages outweigh drawbacks and, overall, the Mensa is quite good for what it is. Besides, the dining options in Campus Golm are limited and between Mensa, Caffetteria in the Library and a nearby Rewe Mensa is easily the best variant.
