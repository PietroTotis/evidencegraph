The canteen offers a large selection of dishes that are always very tasty. Each dish is accompanied by a free dessert. The prices for students are cheap, good price-quality ratio. The staff of the canteen is always nice and friendly. But unfortunately there are too many people in the lunchtime and it is often difficult to find a free place. Otherwise I can only recommend this canteen.
