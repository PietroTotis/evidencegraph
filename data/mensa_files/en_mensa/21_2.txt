The canteen of the University of Potsdam is always worth a visit. There are different offers every day, even for Vegetarians and Vegans. The pricing is very reasonable and even during rush hours the wait isn’t too long. I especially like the fact that every menu contains a tasty dessert. I would definitely recommend this canteen!
