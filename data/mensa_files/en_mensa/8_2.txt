The large selection of the dishes is very positive about the canteen in Golm. There should be something nice to eat for everyone and especially for everyone with a small budget. The canteen is very big but unfortunately you can not find a place to sit. 
The students are very hectic because they want to find a place to sit which leads to an unpleasant loudness and an overcrowded dirty canteen. You do not feel good in such a canteen.
All in all I would not recommend a visit to the canteen in Golm.
