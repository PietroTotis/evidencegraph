In the middle of the rural Golm lies a campus of the University of Potsdam. Every day hundreds of students flock from buses and trains to study at one of the most modern science locations in the region. The Mensa is nestled between lecture halls and dormitories. Completely renovated several years ago, the canteen's friendly dining rooms offer plenty of space on two levels. In addition, the building is completely enclosed by an arcade so that students of the University of Potsdam can eat outdoors in almost any weather. In summer, the spacious terrace invites you to communicate, relax and eat. I will definitely recommend visiting the Golmer Mensa to my fellow students.
