I can warmly recommend a visit to the canteen of Golm to my fellow students, as I could gather only positive impressions so far. The canteen of Golm offers a well-balanced range of food and there are also special counters for vegans and noodle lovers where they can serve themselves individually every day. The quality of the dishes as well as the quantity of portions are absolutely satisfactory and the serving runs always fast and smoothly. Moreover, the food prices for the students of the University of Potsdam are really very fair and reasonable. Furthermore, the Mensa offers variable and sufficient seating possibilities. Personally, I would recommend visiting the Mensa outside of the strongest rush hour, which runs from about 11.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., as there can be a shortage of seating at this time, especially if you are travelling in larger groups and would like to sit down together at one table. Outside lunchtime, there is also the possibility, whether alone or in groups, to take a seat and dedicate oneself to one's homework assignments or to learn. I personally belong to those who prefer to use the premises of the university library for this purpose, but the possibility is definitely there as well. I would also like to draw your attention to the seating possibilities available outside the Mensa building. During the warmer months it is very comfortable to stay there.
