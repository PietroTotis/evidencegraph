I cannot recommend the Golmer Mensa because I have not eaten there so far and this is an important factor for me to evaluate and recommend a Mensa. Furthermore, I prefer the small caf√© of the Studentenwerk located close to the campus. Also the comments of the other pupils, about the unsalted and cold food, did not inspire me to visit the Golmer Mensa more than once.
