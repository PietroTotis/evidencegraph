You can find the Golmer Mensa in the back of the campus. They offer you a wide range of dishes. There are warm dishes with a dessert with or without meat, salad as a light fare, a wide spectrum of drinks and they also offer sandwiches and bakery products.
The quality of the meals is very well compared to other cantines and the price is affordable for students.
Because the mensa is very small, unfortunately it gets very full at rush hour and you will probably need some time to find a seat.
Despite the occasional lack of room, I can recommend to everyone to visit the mensa, because the meals really tasty and in addition to that, the atmosphere in the mensa is very pleasant.
