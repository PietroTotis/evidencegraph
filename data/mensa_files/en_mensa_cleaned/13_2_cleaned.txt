After spending many lunch breaks during my first semester in the canteen of the Potsdamer University on the Campus Golm, I can only recommend it to my fellow students.
The offered meals taste good, compared to the food that I know from other canteens actually really good.
A positive aspect for me is that there is always a vegeterian or vegan alternative for the „classic meals“, what, as a Vegetarian, is playing me into my hands.
The atmosphere in the canteen is comfortable and cozy, most of the time one is able to find a seat, that is absolutely not self-evident for a studentical institution.
The reason for it is probably that the rush of students is scattered by the long opening hours.
In the summer, it is possible to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air while eating what I really like and also loved to do in warmer temperatures.
