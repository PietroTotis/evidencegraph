Even though it’s a cliché that eating canteen food is something one should rather not experience, there is not much bad to say about the canteen on our campus.
There are quite some meals on the menu and there’s a dish for each preference.
No matter if you’re a vegan, a vegetarian or an omnivore – you are probably going to find something you like.
And if you don’t, you can still help yourself at the pasta bar or get a salad.
Of course the canteen is not a five-star-restaurant, but there definitely is attention on quality and the attempt to draw on seasonal and regional food.
Sadly, this attempt does not yet concern the source of meat.
As someone who does not consume meat, this is a little more irrelevant, but it might be interesting for those fellow students who do.
In case one is struggling with certain allergies, there is no need to panic, as allergens and additives are labelled.
What is also worth pointing out, is that for students the food is really affordable almost regardless of the diverse ways to eat.
So the price-performance ratio is fine and as it is possible to either pay cash or use the student chip card, there are no further complications.
Furthermore, the canteen has been recently refurbished and provides enough space, especially when the weather is good and one can sit and eat outside on the terrace.
The canteen provides barrier-free access and thanks to a children’s zone it is no problem for young parents to bring their kids.
For me personally, the time slot during which the food is given out, is a little too early, but this is a thing of individual preference and as the canteen is open until 5 p.m. almost every day, that is not really a problem.
All in one I can say that it is worth paying the canteen on campus Golm a visit.
