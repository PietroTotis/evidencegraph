First of all, I would say that the canteen is definitely very small and because of this you hardly find a free seat, especially at lunchtime.
The menu is very boring and monotonous.
As a vegetarian I don’t have much choice in the menu and the few dishes that I can eat don’t taste very good and are pretty much the same every week.
The loud and restless mood in the canteen is very annoying while eating.
The only good point are the cheap prices.
So to sum up, I would not recommend eating in the canteen in Golm.
