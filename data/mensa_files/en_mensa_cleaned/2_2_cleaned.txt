I recommend eating at the Golmer Mensa.
The food is great, the price is fine and the staff is friendly.
Also, it's possible to look up which dishes are being sold every day online which is useful too.
Unofortunately, the Mensa isn't in the central of the campus.
Depending on the place you have a course in, that makes it more or less timeconsuming and sometimes one doesn't have enough time to spend the breaks there to eat.
