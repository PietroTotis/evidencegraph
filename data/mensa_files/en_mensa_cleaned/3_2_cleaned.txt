I would recommend visiting the canteen in Golm because the price/performance ratio is better than the ones in restaurants.
Besides the quality of the food is good, even though there are only a few vegetarian or vegan alternatives.
Although one has always the choice of going to the noodle bar if there is no other dish that is appealing enough.
What I like most is that there is always a dessert included in the price for the main dish.
But I have the impression that the canteen at Neues Palais has a better selection of dishes and offers some dishes that I have never seen in Golm like the veggie-burger.
During the peak time around lunch it is very hard to find seats and the waiting time you have for getting your food is quite long.
Nevertheless, I can say that you should get a meal there at least once.
