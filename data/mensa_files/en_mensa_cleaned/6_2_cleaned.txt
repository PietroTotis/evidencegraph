The Mensa Golm is a beautiful large and bright facility where you can not only dine, but also learn and work outside lunchtime.
The Mensa offers an extensive range of meals from Monday-Thursday 08:00-17:00 and Friday 08:00-15:00.
The Mensa Golm has a wide choice of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes, as well as a vegan option.
The portions are filling and contain per menu a piece of fruit or another dessert.
The dishes are not only not expensive (1.40-3.00 euros for students), they also taste good.
At lunchtime (12-13 o'clock) you should plan a bit more time, as it can get very full.
