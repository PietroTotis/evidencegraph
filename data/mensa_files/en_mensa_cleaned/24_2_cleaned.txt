I can only recommend my fellow students to use the services offered by our campus' canteen.
You can buy food at an affordable price and with a relatively wide range of menus to choose from even the picky eater will find something to their liking.
Although the place is always quite crowded around midday, in the afternoon there aren't that many people around which allows you to stay at the tables after you have finished eating and chat or do homework with other students while finishing the day in a relaxed atmosphere.
