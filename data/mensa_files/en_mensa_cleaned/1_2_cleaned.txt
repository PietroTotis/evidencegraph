In my personal experience, I would not necessarily recommend my fellow students to visit the canteen in Golm.
So far, I did not like the food in the cafeteria and also it's more expensive compared to the food I cook at home.
However, if you forgot your lunch box at home and you were hungry, you could still go to the cafeteria.
The vegan options are mostly creative and not just consist of salad and tofu.
