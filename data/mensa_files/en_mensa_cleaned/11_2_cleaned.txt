Generally, I think that the Mensa Golm is worth recommending.
Close to most buildings on the campus, various meal options are served between 11 AM and 2 PM, which never exceed the cost of 2,50â‚¬.
The meals offer variation and are most of the time of high quality.
Both the taste and the amount are adequate: the latter most of the time is more than you can eat.
There is a salad bar in case none of the meals suit your taste.
But often times, popular meals are gone before 1 PM.
Another negative aspect is the lack of seats available in the winter, it is hard to find a chair during rush hour, especially as a group.
Despite most of the meals being tasty, the Mensa often fails at authentically cooking "exotic" meals: hummus is just warm lentil sludge, the salsa is just tomato sauce.
But generally, I think that the Mensa is a good place to get lunch, and offers greater quality than most cafeterias in Berlin, for example.
