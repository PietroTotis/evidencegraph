Between the listed buildings of the campus, the Mensa Golm stands out due to its modern design.
The interior is new as well and offers space for a large number of students.
However, it should be noted that at peak times, especially in winter, the Mensa is overcrowded and places are insufficient.
The food in the Mensa is regional and varied.
There are options for vegetarians and vegans, and there is at least one vegetarian dish on the daily menu.
The price-performance ratio is satisfactory for the student budget.
Already from 1,40€ one can get a meal, in this price class mostly soups and desserts are included.
As I am vegetarian, my choice is unfortunately limited.
If one does not maintain alternative eating habits, this should not be important, because different dishes containing meat and fish are offered daily.
I often visit the Mensa, because the food is affordable and the portions are appropriate.
But the best thing is, that you get a free dessert with every meal.
The homemade yoghurts, curds and puddings are recommended.
It is not a matter of course to get desserts, fruit or even sauces without extra charge.
In my opinion, it is worth eating in the Mensa Golm, especially if you don't feel like cooking.
