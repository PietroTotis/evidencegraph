In general, I would recommend a visit of the Golmer Mensa, because the food for students convinces with its great price-performance ratio.
The price per portion ranges from 1,40 euros to 2,50 euros, depending on the kind of the meal.
Therefore, the price is very affordable.
At the same time the food surprises with high quality and the offer with its diversity of different meals.
All forms of nutrition are considered.
Furthermore, there is the 'pasta counter' where you can create your own pasta dish flexibly.
