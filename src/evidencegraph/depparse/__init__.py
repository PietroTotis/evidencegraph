"""
This module contains parts of Leif Johnson's depgraph package (v0.1.0):
the Digraph class and the implementation of the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm.

The depparse package had been available from PyPi and from its source
repository (http://github.com/lmjohns3/py-depparse/) for quite a while,
but has been deleted recently.

There still exist a few forks from it, e.g. one in my github account:
https://github.com/peldszus/py-depparse. The bare library code without
setup.py, scripts, tests and data is also available as part of a
documentation published at http://pydoc.net/depparse/0.1.0/.

The code is licensed under the MIT License, see the headers of
the source files.
